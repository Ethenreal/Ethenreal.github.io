<h3>Welcome to my Project Page</h3>
<div2>
<div3>
	<p2>My name is Michael Hammond, I have created this webpage for my Art 121 class. 
	I will be posting my current and future projects as well as artist statements to explain my reasoning and background.
I have always loved art, it is my passion! Anywhere from designing tattoos to doodling in notebooks in class. I am a Junior at Oregon State University, majoring in New Media Communication. 
My dream is to create new worlds in games, whether VR, AR, or just video games in general.
I've created this site to put recent or current multimedia projects on. 
It will be home to many different pieces that I feel are important to share, to give a window into who I am. 
This includes stories, videos, pictures, etc. and will be part of my final project! </p2>

<h2>Culture Jam: Dreamworks</h2>
</div4>
<div3>
		<p>Dreamworks animation has had a lot of success over the years, one obvious way is making 
reboots and sequels and prequels and anything else they can think of to squeeze the acting 
ability out of their company. I used the sentence 'your Dreams-work for profits' as an allusion to 
childrens and viewers dreams coming true in the movie, creating a new world where their 
imaginations can run wild. Using this basis to profit off their dreams and use their influence to 
get as much money from willing customers as possible.  
Accompanying it with the actors hanging from bird cages in the background with a 'Dreamworks Contract' stuck to them. This is meant to symbolize the control the studio has over 
these actors, coaxing them into years of contracts and legal obligations in order to make more 
money. Their dreams to become actors and be leading roles in great big blockbuster movies, 
taken advantage of by a billion-dollar corporation, with an empty space at the ending of their 
time slots to show that they may never escape. The company symbol sitting on a big pile of 
money, the peoples money, fishing for more with their promises of movies with the stars we 
love in them. </p>

		<p> For project 1 we used <p5>Adobe Photoshop</p5> exclusively with found photos on the internet. 
		For mine I tried to ahve a more seamless look to it, transitioning from one part of the picture to the other. 
This was my first interaction with adobe Photoshop and learned everything I know about it during the process of this project. 
I learned how to blend objects together using color and texture, as well as cropping out different pictures to make them look similar.
We also used the cloning tool to make letters with the same style and color as the originals, this is how I made the "your" as well as "For Profits." 
I went through hours of copy/pasting different items like the Dreamworks logo itself. 
This was in order to still have the white background but make it look as if he is sitting on a pile of money. The audiences money.
Below you will find the finished project! We had to print it in CMYK rather than RGB so it would hold color better. 
This is where the class learned how to export and save our projects as PDF files and JPEG files in order to turn them in.</p>

		<h2>Video Mashup: "Rain"</h2>
	</div>
	<div2>
		<p> My piece is about depression, with personal and general experience with it I feel a strong connection to the subject. 
		The meaning is working alone, already plagued by loneliness or sadness, oftentimes people with depression will let it go unnoticed.
Instead doing activities or projects to keep their minds and bodies busy, only prolonging the inevitable. 
This is something that comes from personal influence, with nearly 21 years under my belt I can assuredly say that there has been a struggle with depression. 
Not only myself but friends and family around me. The movies taken were interrelated in that they were memorable to me. 
I felt they depicted scenes that reminded me of experiences of running from the problem alone rather than facing it with those that love you.  
Countless people are affected by this every day and few people take notice, sometimes simply because they choose not to make it obvious.
Who really wants to feel that way though, begging for somebody's help. It is not often that they feel they have those people in their lives they can rely on in the first place. 
It is meant to inspire others to ask for help, whether a stranger or someone close to them. 
Rather than fighting with the inner demons chasing them, stand and outnumber them with the love of others.<p>

		</video>
		</div>
	<div2>
		<p>This project was created using <p5>Adobe Premier Pro</p5>, using videos I took off the internet. 
			I chose movies that I could find specific scenes for, fighting, running, yelling. 
			I wanted to use these scenes to convey all they emotions I have felt when dealing with depression.
It was also made out of original video content, it only took me about an hour to get all the footage I needed. 
Using Premier Pro I clipped specific areas of the videos I needed to follow my message.
After getting all the videos in the right place, I had to adjust the audio. 
Without being allowed to use songs with any lyrics in them, I chose to rely on instrumentals that felt like they had a powerful emotional connection.
I was able to use a special effect to make multiple versions of myself in a single shot, usually it is meant to delete an object from a video but I reversed 
the process to make the background disappear and focus on the other "me" in the video.
The last bit was choosing when the music should fade in and out, how to make it compliment the video the most and not take away from what was happening in the video.</p>

		<h2>Interdimensional Forms: Remastered Gryphon</h2>
	</div>
		<div2>
		<p>The Gryphon has always been known to be a majestic and powerful creature, believed
to have originated in Egypt. The head of an eagle and body of a lion does seem very majestic,
the masters of the sky and earth. This combination never quite seemed like a good fit to me, it
felt too big to be able to be quick and sneaky. I have seen iterations where it is a finch and a cat
instead, but this also seems too small to really have the same powerful impact it is meant to
have. I chose to stick with the eagle to still have the majestic quality that eagles have. A lion
seemed too big to me, gryphons origin was protecting and guarding precious items, it did not
feel the same. Sticking with the big cat family, I chose a panther instead, something that would
blend into the environment and be sneakier and able to hide treasure and items easily.
For the design of the gryphon I chose the backstory to be, from the centuries of
guarding precious items and treasures, they began to realize a different way to do it. What is
safer than being with the keeper and protector at all times? So, when they were hatching their
young, they laid their eggs in a pile of gold and jewels and stones to keep them protected and
cared for. When they were about to hatch, they heated the eggs up to help loosen them, and
when the babies came out, they were soaked and covered in the precious items. Parts of their
bodies being covered by the incredibly strong metals and jewels, this would help protect not
only their young (like a natural armor against attackers at birth), but make sure that these
precious items never fell into the wrong hands.</p>

</div>
		<div2>
		<p>This project was the most time consuming and one with the shortest time frame to get it finished. 
		I worked with two different mediums to create this. With a software on my laptop called <p5>"Paint 3D"</p5> and photoshop, I created the gif on the top half of the video.
	The second medium I used was clay, originally at least. 
	I got about halfway done and realized I hadn't taken into account how much clay I would need for the feathers and fur and such. 
After that realization I printed out a model of my original 3D model, 
using old cans of different sorts to create "gold," "rubies," and "sapphires" and used paint to put on the black fur for the panther half.
I learned how much time it took to print something about 5 inches tall and 3 inches wide, which is about 4 hours depending on the detail. 
There is also a cleaning process to the 3D model which came as a surprise, it did not take long but it was difficult trying not to break the more fragile parts of the model.
The software I used allowed me choose exactly how I wanted to shape each piece of the gryphon. This allowed me to make every individual part; feathers, wings, legs, body, beak, etc.</p>

		<h2>Artist Zine: "Who are you"</h2>
	</div>
		<div2>
		<p>This piece comes at a time where I was very unsure of who I was. I was lost in a sea of people and things going on in my life that I had no idea what the outcome may be. It made me wonder, "who am I?"
How do we really know, when do we know? If there really is a time where we can truly understand who we are and what we are, how will we know we are at that point. Personally the most difficult part would be deciding what is best for myself.
Being so outwardly focused in most aspects of life, it is difficult to transition and imagine the best scenario for ourselves. it is necessary if we are ever to make it through life, but how can we balance that with who we aspire to be and who we truly are deep inside.
Who are we, what makes us who we are? Growing up each of us got a life's supply of advice from adults, friends, family, but who's to say what's actually right? What path are we really meant to follow, only we can know and even then it's at random! 
I am challenging the notion that youth is the plague on the world, that wisdom comes with age and that advice and understanding can't come from someone no older than a teen. 
Nobody truly knows what is right and wrong, "There is no inherit right or wrong in this world, those labels are just artificial constructs. Right and wrong are held by positions of authority, that's the way it has always been."</p>

			<p>There wasn't much difference between this system and the other projects. 
			Really the only difference was that this could be more abstract, it wasn't so difficult to find pictures and specific scenes in videos that would fit the exact mold.
			This project came from the heart, as did all the others, but this was truly something that was just right out of my imagination. 
			Working with Photoshop again made it very easy, it was much simpler than before after my prior experience. 
			I decided to make it a little more difficult, doing more things similar to the way I had in my "Dreamworks" project.
			I cut out very small and detailed pieces from the pages so I could fit them over another piece that would fit in with the subject.
			This made it difficult, but after seeing how much cleaner and well-kept it was afterward, it made the long, tedious process worth it.</p>
